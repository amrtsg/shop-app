- Have home primary vehicle update upon setting it. (not only once on mount)
- Create a alert object (a modal) with props for title, desc and button text.
- fix weird keyboard bouncing back and forth on android. (if you cant replicate keep opening and closing KB)
- Make it so that if there is only 1 vehicle, it automatically becomes the primary
